# CVE-2023-47504 POC

Exploit for CVE-2023-47504.
According to NIST, this vulnerability should allow unauthenticated users to access functionalities in the Elementor Website Builder Plugin.
Based on my research into the vulnerability, and also judging by the URL from Patchstack that describes the vulnerability: `https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/elementor/wordpress-elementor-plugin-3-16-4-contributor-arbitrary-attachment-read-vulnerability?_s_id=cve`, I recon this is actually requires credentials for at least a subscriber account.
Also, for the exploit to work one needs access to the `wp-config.php` file of the target website. 

## Requirements

1. Credentials for at least a subscriber account
2. Access to `wp-config.php`
3. Authorization to exploit the website ;)
